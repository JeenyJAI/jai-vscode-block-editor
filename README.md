Bridge between AI code generation and your IDE. Execute AI-suggested changes with simple DSL commands (REPLACE, DELETE, INSERT) across multiple files.

## Features

- **Smart Replace** - Replace code blocks across multiple files simultaneously
- **Bulk Delete** - Remove unwanted code patterns everywhere at once
- **Precision Insert** - Add code at exact positions (before/after blocks, start/end of files)
- **Boundary Blocks** - Define complex replacements with start/end boundaries using `---TO---`
- **Multi-file Operations** - Use glob patterns to target specific file groups
- **Pre-execution Analysis** - independent analysis of each command (not a preview of cascading changes)
- **Format Preservation** - Maintains original file encoding and line endings

## Quick Start

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run `JAI: Block Editor (DSL)`
3. Enter your DSL commands
4. Press `Ctrl+Enter` to apply changes

## DSL Commands

### Replace Block
```dsl
replace block
---BEGIN---
DEBUG = True
---END---
with
---BEGIN---
DEBUG = False
---END---
in files ["config.py", "settings/*.py"]
```

### Delete Block
```dsl
delete block
---BEGIN---
# TODO: Remove after migration
def legacy_function():
    pass
---END---
in files ["src/**/*.py"]
```

### Insert Code
```dsl
insert after
---BEGIN---
class User:
---END---
with
---BEGIN---
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
---END---
in files ["models.py"]
```

### Boundary Blocks (with ---TO---)
```dsl
replace block
---BEGIN---
def process_data(data):
    # Start of function
---TO---
    return result
    # End of function
---END---
with
---BEGIN---
def process_data(data):
    # Optimized implementation
    if not data:
        return None
    
    result = optimize(data)
    log_performance(result)
    return result
    # End of function
---END---
```

## File Patterns

```dsl
in files ["config.py"]                        # single file
in files ["config.py", "settings.py"]         # multiple files
in files ["src/"]                             # all files in directory (recursive)
in files ["*.py"]                             # pattern in current directory
in files ["src/*.py"]                         # pattern in specific directory
in files ["**/test_*.py"]                     # recursive pattern
in files ["config.py", "src/", "tests/*.py"]  # combination
```

**Pattern Rules:**
- Paths ending with `/` - directories (recursive search)
- `*` - any characters within single level
- `**` - recursive search in all subdirectories
- All patterns are processed as glob patterns
- If no files specified - uses current active file

## Multiple Commands

Use `---NEXT_BLOCK---` to execute multiple operations at once:

```dsl
replace block
---BEGIN---
VERSION = "1.0.0"
---END---
with
---BEGIN---
VERSION = "2.0.0"
---END---
in files ["version.py"]

---NEXT_BLOCK---

insert after
---BEGIN---
VERSION = "2.0.0"
---END---
with
---BEGIN---
RELEASE_DATE = "2024-01-01"
---END---
in files ["version.py"]
```

## Pre-execution Analysis

Before applying changes, the extension performs analysis and shows:

```
PRE-EXECUTION ANALYSIS
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Total commands: 34
Matches found: 30
No matches for: 4 commands
Parse errors: 0

Details:
- Commands 0003, 0004, 0005, 0006 will be skipped (blocks not found)

Continue with applying changes?
[Apply]  [Cancel]
```

**Important**: Preview analyzes each command independently. When applied sequentially, commands may affect each other, so final result may differ from pre-analysis.

## Supported Operations

- `replace block` - replace all block occurrences
- `delete block` - delete all block occurrences
- `insert before` - insert before each block occurrence
- `insert after` - insert after each block occurrence
- `insert at start` - insert at file start
- `insert at end` - insert at file end

## Advanced Examples

### Complex Function Replacement
```dsl
replace block
---BEGIN---
def validate_email(email):
    if not email:
        return False
    return '@' in email
---END---
with
---BEGIN---
def validate_email(email):
    if not email or '@' not in email:
        return False
    if email.count('@') != 1:
        return False
    local, domain = email.split('@')
    return len(local) > 0 and len(domain) > 3 and '.' in domain
---END---
in files ["validators.py", "utils/validation.py"]
```

### Mass Debug Cleanup
```dsl
delete block
---BEGIN---
console.log('DEBUG:
---TO---
');
---END---
in files ["src/**/*.js", "!node_modules/"]
```

### Add License Headers
```dsl
insert at start
with
---BEGIN---
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
Copyright (c) 2024 Your Company
Licensed under MIT License
"""

---END---
in files ["src/**/*.py"]
```

## Configuration

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `blockEditor.validatePaths`: Enable path validation for security (default: `true`)
* `blockEditor.mixedEolPolicy`: How to handle mixed line endings (`warn`, `ignore`, `skip`, `normalize`)
* `blockEditor.enableVerboseLogging`: Enable verbose logging for debugging (default: `false`)

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.85.0 or higher

## Known Issues

- Binary files are automatically skipped
- Very large files (>100MB) may cause performance issues
- Mixed line endings in files will trigger a warning by default

## Release Notes

### 0.1.0

Initial release with core features:
- DSL commands for REPLACE, DELETE, INSERT operations
- Multi-file support with glob patterns
- Pre-execution analysis
- Boundary blocks with `---TO---` separator
- Cross-platform line ending preservation
- Mixed line endings detection
- Secure path validation

## Security

Block Editor operates only within your workspace boundaries:
- Automatic validation that files are within workspace
- Protection against path traversal attacks
- No access to files outside the project
